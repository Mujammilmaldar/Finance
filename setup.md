Okay, absolutely! It's always a good idea to have a clear, step-by-step guide.

Here is a consolidated "Main Steps" guide for starting your Tamagui-powered React Native finance bot project, incorporating all the solutions we've found for your specific environment.

Project: Tamagui Finance Bot (Main Setup Steps)

This guide will help you set up a new React Native (Expo) project using Tamagui's universal monorepo template. This ensures high performance, a great developer experience, and the flexibility to expand to web later.

Step 1: Prerequisites & Environment Setup
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (LTS Version): Download and install from nodejs.org. This will also install npm.

Git: Download and install from git-scm.com.

VS Code (Recommended IDE): Download and install from code.visualstudio.com.

Step 2: Install Yarn Globally
The Tamagui starter template is optimized for Yarn (a package manager). We need to install it globally on your system.

Open PowerShell (as Administrator is best).

Run the following command:

PowerShell

npm install -g yarn
Verify Yarn installation:

PowerShell

yarn --version
You should see a version number.

Step 3: Create Your Tamagui Project
Due to issues with spaces in your Windows user path, we'll create the project in a safe location.

Open PowerShell.

Navigate to a root directory without spaces:

PowerShell

cd C:\
mkdir MyProjects # Create a folder for your projects, if you don't have one
cd MyProjects
(Alternatively, if you prefer C:\Tamagui, just cd C:\Tamagui)

Run the Tamagui create command with a temporary cache location:
This command will create your new project in C:\MyProjects\finance (or C:\Tamagui\finance).

PowerShell

npx --cache C:\MyProjects\npm-cache create-tamagui@latest
(If you are in C:\Tamagui, use npx --cache C:\Tamagui\npm-cache create-tamagui@latest)

When prompted for "Ok to proceed?", type y and press Enter.

For "Project name:", type finance (or your preferred name like FinanceBot).

For "Pick a template:", use the arrow keys to select:
Free - Expo + Next in a production ready monorepo
Then press Enter.

Step 4: Resolve React Version Conflict & Install Dependencies
The create-tamagui script might install React v19, which conflicts with Next.js v14. We need to manually downgrade React to v18 and then install all project dependencies.

Navigate into your new project directory:

PowerShell

cd finance
Open the project in VS Code:

PowerShell

code .
Edit package.json:

In the root of your project (C:\MyProjects\finance\package.json), find the dependencies section.

Change the react and react-dom versions to ^18.2.0.

FROM (e.g.):

JSON

"dependencies": {
  "react": "^19.0.0",
  "react-dom": "^19.0.0",
  // ... other dependencies
},
TO:

JSON

"dependencies": {
  "react": "^18.2.0",
  "react-dom": "^18.2.0",
  // ... other dependencies
},
Save the package.json file.

Install all project dependencies using Yarn:
In your terminal (still in C:\MyProjects\finance or C:\Tamagui\finance), run:

PowerShell

yarn install
This will take a few minutes.

Step 5: Run Your Application
Once yarn install is complete, your project is ready!

To run your React Native (mobile) app:

PowerShell

yarn native
This will start the Metro bundler.

You can then scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your physical phone, or open it in an Android emulator or iOS simulator.

To run your Web (Next.js) app (optional):

PowerShell

yarn web
This will start the Next.js development server.

Open your browser to http://localhost:3000 (or the port indicated in the terminal).
